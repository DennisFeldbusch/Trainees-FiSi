The <code>Registry</code> is a place where <code>images</code> are stored. You can also create your own <code>Registry</code> to store your own <code>images</code> or upload your own <code>images</code> to Docker Hub.</p> <p>You can define multiple <code>containers</code> in a <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file. This way, you can run multiple <code>containers</code> at once. Then you can also create dependencies between the <code>containers</code>. For example, you can create a <code>container</code> for a database and a <code>container</code> for a web server. Then you create a dependency between them, so that the web server <code>container</code> will only start when the database <code>container</code> is running.</p> <pre><code>graph TD\n    A[Dockerfile] --&gt; B[Image]\n    B --&gt; C[Web Container]\n    D[Registry download] --&gt; E[Image]\n    E --&gt; F[DB Container]\n    C --&gt; G[Compose]\n    F --&gt; G\n    G --&gt; H[Web Container]\n    G --&gt; I[DB Container]\n    H o--o I\n    H --&gt; J[Port 80]\n    I --&gt; K[Port 3306]</code></pre>"},{"location":"virtualization/3_docker/#getting-started","title":"Getting Started","text":"<p>You can run Docker on your local machine (via Docker Desktop) or on a server (via CLI).</p> <p>You can find a tutorial on how to get started with Docker here.</p>"},{"location":"virtualization/3_docker/#docker-desktop","title":"Docker Desktop","text":"<p>Docker Desktop is the easiest way to get started with Docker.
