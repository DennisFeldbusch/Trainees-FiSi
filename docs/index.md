# Welcome, new trainee!

This is a documentation to learn the basics of the FiSi trainee program.

## Order

- First, we will setup a basic network with an FritzBox router and a client. This will be your first start to get familiar with the basics.
- After that, we will setup a virtual network with Mininet. We will mainly use this to test our configuration before deploying it on real hardware.
- Then we will setup a real network with a router and real switches.
- Finally, we will setup some servers and services to get a infrastructure like a company would have (e.g. a webserver, a mailserver, a fileserver, ...)

<div id="hidden-solution">
<h4> Our solution to the quiz is: </h4>

```bash
sudo mn --topo single,3 --mac --switch ovsk --controller remote
```

The hidden solution is appended to the quiz at the exact position where the hidden solution is defined.

The hidden solution needs to be defined as a div with the id "hidden-solution". (This is the only way to hide the solution header from the table of contents)

</div>

### No longer hidden
