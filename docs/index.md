# Welcome, new trainee!

This is a documentation to learn the basics as an FiSi trainee.

## Structure

[timeline(docs/timeline.json)]

!!! note

    There are some further topics in the navigation bar, but they are not essential for the trainee project.

## Main topics

- First, we will do a few projects with [Boards](iot/index.md), like the Raspberry Pi, to get familiar with some basic hardware.
- After that, we will setup some [virtual machines](virtualization/index.md) to a basic infrastructure.
- Then we will setup a [network](networking/index.md) with a router and real switches.
  - We will also setup some servers and services to get a infrastructure like a company would have (e.g. a webserver, a mailserver, a fileserver, ...)
- Lastly, you can choose some other topics like [coding](coding/index.md) or [AI](ai/index.md). These are not essential for the trainee project, but you can learn a lot from them.

## Prepare yourself

- Get familiar with the [Linux command line](https://www2.icp.uni-stuttgart.de/~icp/mediawiki/images/b/bd/Sim_Meth_I_T0_cheat_sheet_10_11.pdf)
