# Welcome, new trainee!

This is a documentation to learn the basics of the FiSi trainee program.

## Order

- First, we will setup a basic network with an FritzBox router and a client. This will be your first start to get familiar with the basics.
- After that, we will setup a virtual network with Mininet. We will mainly use this to test our configuration before deploying it on real hardware.
- Then we will setup a real network with a router and real switches.
- Finally, we will setup some servers and services to get a infrastructure like a company would have (e.g. a webserver, a mailserver, a fileserver, ...)
