# Self Documentation of the Trainee Project

This is for the creators of this trainee project.

## Structure

The navigation gets build from the `.pages` files in the folders and subfolders (`awesome-pages` plugin).

## Information content

- The project is structured in a way, that the trainee can learn the basics of IT infrastructure and coding.
- This project is not meant to be a complete documentation of all topics, but rather a starting point for the trainee to learn the basics and then continue to learn on their own.
  - The several topics should contain some basic information, but not too much.
  - They mainly contain links to further information and tutorials.
  - Preferably, the trainee should get a task to do, which they have to solve on their own.
  - At the end of each topic, it would be nice to have a quiz to test the knowledge of the trainee.
